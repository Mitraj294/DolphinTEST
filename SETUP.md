# Setup guide — Dolphin (backend + frontend)

This file summarizes the minimal steps and requirements to get the project running locally.

Prerequisites
- PHP 8.2 (composer.json requires php ^8.2)
- Composer (latest stable)
- MySQL or MariaDB running locally
- Node.js 16+ and npm (or pnpm)
- Git

Quick steps (recommended)

1) Backend

```bash
cd Dolphin_Backend
composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set DB_HOST, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, APP_URL
php artisan key:generate
php artisan storage:link
php artisan migrate --seed
```

Notes:
- The project ships OAuth keys in `storage/` (check `storage/oauth-private.key` and `storage/oauth-public.key`). If missing, run `php artisan passport:install`.
- `DatabaseSeeder` seeds Roles and creates a Super Admin with email `sdolphin632@gmail.com` and password `superadmin@123` (change after first login).
- `OrganizationAssessmentQuestionSeeder` currently contains no data (kept for backward compatibility). `DatabaseSeeder` will insert some default assessment `questions` if the `questions` table exists.

2) Frontend

```bash
cd Dolphin_Frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL if backend URL differs
npm run dev  # or npm run serve / npm run build depending on your workflow
```

3) Start both services (convenience)

From repo root you can use the helper script:

```bash
./start-dev.sh
# And stop with:
./stop-dev.sh
```

Troubleshooting
- If migrations fail: verify `.env` DB_* values and ensure MySQL is running and accessible.
- If seeders fail due to missing tables: run `php artisan migrate` first, inspect migrations list under `Dolphin_Backend/database/migrations`.
- If you see OAuth or Passport errors, ensure `storage/oauth-*.key` files are present or run `php artisan passport:install`.
- If frontend can't reach backend, ensure CORS in `config/cors.php` allows your frontend host (defaults to localhost).

Running tests

```bash
cd Dolphin_Backend
composer install --dev
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Optional: automated installs
- I can run `composer install` and `npm install` in the workspace and run migrations for you. Tell me if you want me to run them now from this environment.
