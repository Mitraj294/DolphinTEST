//Role & Permission Configuration for DolphinProject

//Contains:
// - ROLES: All available user roles in the system
// - PERMISSIONS: Allowed routes for each role
// - canAccess(): Utility for permission checking by route/component

//Usage:
// - Import ROLES and PERMISSIONS where needed
// - Use canAccess(role, type, name) to check route/component access

// 1. Role Definitions

export const ROLES = {
  SUPERADMIN: "superadmin",
  DOLPHINADMIN: "dolphinadmin",
  USER: "user",
  ORGANIZATIONADMIN: "organizationadmin",
  SALESPERSON: "salesperson",

// 2. Permissions Mapping (Allowed Routes By Role)
